## 📖 About the Project

The **AROMA - Ayush Repository of Medicinal Applications** is part of the AYUSH Ministry's initiative to promote awareness of traditional medicinal plants. This login module serves as the gateway for users to access the interactive platform. Built with user-centric design in mind, the login system is fast, modern, and integrates with backend services to ensure a smooth authentication experience.

This UI component will be integrated into the broader AROMA platform which features:
